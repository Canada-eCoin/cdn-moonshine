# Bitbip

![](header.png)

> Bitbip is an open-source, non-custodial, Bitcoin/Litecoin Electrum wallet for iOS & Android.

CAUTION: **Caution:**
This app is still heavily in development. I encourage users to only utilize the Testnet chains at this time. Otherwise, please use at your own risk.

Built with React Native, Bitbip utilizes Electrum's JSON-RPC methods to interact with the Bitcoin/Litecoin network.

Bitbip's intended use is as a hot wallet.
Meaning, your keys are only as safe as the device you install this wallet on.
As with any hot wallet, please ensure that you keep only a small, responsible amount of Bitcoin/Litecoin on it at any given time.

If you are looking for secure cold storage solutions please consider purchasing a [Trezor](https://wallet.trezor.io) or a [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/)

TODOS:
* Features:
    * Please see "0.2.0 Alpha" in Roadmap.
* Known, High-Priority Bugs:
    * Continuous manual refreshes can cause the app to improperly display transaction and balance data and sometimes requires the user to use the "Rescan Wallet" feature in Settings to correct it. This can be frustrating and stressful to the user for obvious reasons.
    * Quickly swapping between coins can cause the nodejs instance to hang, requiring the user restart the app in order to establish a stable connection to the Electrum server.
