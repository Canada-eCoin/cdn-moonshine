# Bitbip

![](header.png)

> Bitbip is an open-source, non-custodial, Bitcoin/Litecoin Electrum wallet for iOS & Android.

CAUTION: **Caution:**
This app is still heavily in development. I encourage users to only utilize the Testnet chains at this time. Otherwise, please use at your own risk.

Built with React Native, Bitbip utilizes Electrum's JSON-RPC methods to interact with the Bitcoin/Litecoin network.

Bitbip's intended use is as a hot wallet.
Meaning, your keys are only as safe as the device you install this wallet on.
As with any hot wallet, please ensure that you keep only a small, responsible amount of Bitcoin/Litecoin on it at any given time.

If you are looking for secure cold storage solutions please consider purchasing a [Trezor](https://wallet.trezor.io) or a [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/)

Bitbip's Alpha is available for download here:

## Altcoin Support
Please be aware and take note that my primary focus is on expanding the core functionality of this wallet and not on adding altcoins. However, for those wishing to add a specific altcoin for personal use, I have created the following guide so that you may fork off in a proper fashion:
